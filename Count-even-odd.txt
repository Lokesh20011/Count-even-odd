Write a Python program to count the number of even and odd numbers from a series of numbers.
Hii = []
oddnumbers = 0
evenumbers = 0
n = int(input("Enter number of elements : "))
for i in range(0, n):
    ele = int(input())
    Hii.append(ele)
for x in Hii:
        if not x % 2:
    	     evenumbers+=1
        else:
    	     oddnumbers+=1
print("Number of even numbers :",evenumbers)
print("Number of odd numbers :",oddnumbers)
